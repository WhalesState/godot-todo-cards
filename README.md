> about:
>> TDC is a plugin that works in the main editor window, it's optimized for performance, no single line of code in `_process`, it depends on the `Signals` only and it only saves when you press Ctrl-S while the plugin window is visible.

> hints:
> > 1- It saves in `'addons/todo-cards'` folder, there's a file called `data.tdp` -> `TodoProject`, it's encrypted. replace it in `real-time` and the project will update when you change window back to godot. if you want to restore to default just delete it and disable then enable the plugin back.

> > 2- You can export and import cards easily, the generated cards are in `'addons/todo-cards/exported-cards'`. it exports `Card Name.tdc` -> `TodoCard` and it's a plain text file. after that you will find all the exported cards that are located in the export folder when you press `Options -> Import`.

> > 3- You can add up to 12 flag colors to each card, it generates a color randomly and you can replace the color when you press on the flag button.
